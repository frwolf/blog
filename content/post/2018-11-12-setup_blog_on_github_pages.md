For the blog itself I have choosen [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), an open-source static site generator,
which is able to generate a website out of some [markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) content files.

I followed the descritption on [https://gohugo.io](https://gohugo.io/hosting-and-deployment/hosting-on-github/#deployment-of-project-pages-from-your-gh-pages-branch)
to set up a blog on GitHub Pages.
