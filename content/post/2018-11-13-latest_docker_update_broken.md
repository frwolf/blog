The latest update of `docker-ce` to `18.09.0~3-0~raspbian-stretch` on `raspbian-stretch`
is broken for the Raspberry Pi Model B Rev 2 as `containerd` refuses to start on this
architecture (`armv6l`) with a core-dump.

The workaround is to downgrade the docker version to a known good version.

#### List the available versions

#### Prevent docker-ce from updating
```
root@raspberrypi:~# apt-mark hold docker-ce
```

#### Cleanup
```
root@raspberrypi:~# apt autoremove
```

After that, the docker deamon should be running again.
